# podcastBuilder

If you use an outliner to write your blog, this will generate a special feed containing the items with enclosures attached. 

Also includes support for the itunes namespace. 

I use it to build the scripting news podcast feed and the podcast0 feed, the stream of the first podcasts I did starting in 2004.
