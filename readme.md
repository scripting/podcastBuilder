# podcastBuilder

If you use an outliner to write your blog, this will generate a special feed containing the items with enclosures attached. 

Includes support for the itunes namespace. The feeds it generates have been accepted by Apple.

I use it to build the Scripting News <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast.xml">podcast-only feed</a> and the podcast0 feed, the stream of the first podcasts I did starting in 2004.
