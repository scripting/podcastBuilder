Why we're using 2024 dates in the Podcast0 feed.

If I hadn't made the mistake of using a 2024 date for the Bill Gates podcast, it would have been great to use 2004 dates. It's so cool to see that in the various clients.

But that means Bill Gates will always be at the top of the list, everywhere, and ruines the reverse chronologic view, and it's a boring podcast. 

So I changed all the dates to 2024 now, that will give them all new guids, and they will all show up as new, unfortunately. 

But from this point on, they will sort out correctly.

It's now possible to build the feed without publishing for testing.

To turn it off, add flPublishFeed: false to your config

If config.s3ArchivePath is defined, we save a copy of the RSS feed in a folder, organized by year.

For the scripting news podcast feed, look for: http://scripting.com/podcast/2024/06.xml

it started with the cuomo podcast during covid, and then i set up podcast0 to generalize it, and now i'm making it a package so i can easily turn scripting news into an apple-compatible podcast.
